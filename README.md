Motion Detector with email notification (Pushingbox) for Arduino

The PIR motion sensor is ideal to detect movement. PIR stand for “Passive Infrared”. Basically, the PIR motion sensor measures infrared light from objects in its field of view. So, it can detect motion based on changes in infrared light in the environment. It is ideal to detect if a human has moved in or out of the sensor range.

PushingBox is a cloud that can send notifications based on API calls.
From one request, you can send several notifications like a Push, a Tweet, an Email.
All this in real time
